## Description
Welcome to my time limited quiz game! I made this quiz with the goal of making a functional game on a webpage and learned many things. The main thing is using local storage to store high scores at the end of the game and at the beggining if you click the view high scores button. Also learned very invaluable javascript lessons including button listeners and timer functions to time limit the game to only 60 seconds and adding 5 seconds when you input a right answer and taking 15 when you get a wrong one. The quiz is pretty simple its just a display of my newlearned knowledge of javascript! Hope you enjoy

Welcome to my Workday Scheduler! I made this scheduler site with the goal of being able to plan out your whole work day from 9-5 while being able to save specific text inputs for every hour. I learned how to implement APIs into my websites and learned how to use Day.js to fetch current date and time information to paint the time containers different colors and also display the current day and date on the header of the screen. While also using local storage to save every entry and it loading up on refresh. All you have to do is type in your task and click save and done! it will be there on reaload. Just a simple display of API inclusion before the big project next week. Thanks for reading!
